The first time you had sex was not perfect. It may have been fun, but it took some time and practice to get it right. The same holds true for sexting. You can enjoy it from the first time that you do it with someone, but that does not mean you cannot get better at it through practice. You need to learn how to sext. While it is possible to explore sexting on your own, you may benefit from learning what others have already found out. That is why these sexting tips are good for anyone that wants to have better sexting.

You want the sexting to occur at a time when they will be able to enjoy the message you send.

Sexting with someone you know and have a relationship involves knowing their schedule and when they like to enjoy the sexual feelings you want to share.
