So, you’ve decided that you want to become a camgirl. Congratulations!

Keep in mind that just like every job, being a camgirl requires hard work and dedication. Let’s face it; many people think that simply owning a webcam and being pretty is enough to earn those big bucks. But, that’s far from true!

_Yes_, you need a webcam, and of course, being pretty _helps_, but if you really want to be successful, you’ll need more than your looks. The key to successful webcam modeling is in _buying the right equipment_.

Basically, [if you’re just getting into the business](/become-webcam-model/ "Become Webcam Model"), getting the best camgirl equipment will keep your audience intrigued and coming back for more, which is what every model strives to achieve.

Now, let’s get started by explaining what webcamming equipment you’ll need.

## The ultimate cam girl starter kit

Ultimately, because you are just starting out, and you don’t have an audience yet, you will need amazing equipment that will present you in the best light!

Once you buy the right equipment, you’ll be able to find the best webcam modeling jobs on the internet!

## The best camming equipment

Overall, there are only a few things that you need in order to get started:

* PC
* Webcam/video camera
* Additional webcam equipment
* Camgirl lighting equipment
* Wireless keyboard and mouse

### Webcam

Unfortunately, if you don’t own a webcam, you will need to buy one. Using the cam on your laptop isn’t a smart move because the quality of the stream won’t be good enough.

You will need a USB HD webcam that can stream 720p videos and above. These webcams usually cost up to $120. Although that may sound a bit steep, especially if you’re strapped for cash, buying a quality webcam will make the payoff better than you expected!

### Video camera

Some cam girls prefer using a video camera to a webcam. In fact, there are several advantages to using a video camera:

* Full HD picture quality
* Built-in zooming features
* Remote control

However, there is also a downside. A quality camera can end up costing you up to $500! Let’s face it, that’s the kind of money few are willing to spend! Well, at least until you start earning some real money. Then you can buy all the cameras you want!

Overall, if you’re a beginner, it’s probably best you start off with a webcam.

## The best webcam for camming

If you’ve decided to go with a webcam, it’s time to find the best webcam for camming. These are some of the most recommended ones:

* Logitech HD C270 ― best webcam for beginners
* Logitech C920 ― best budget webcam
* Logitech C922x ― best professional quality video streaming webcam

Once you decide on one, the next step is getting the right webcam equipment.

### Additional webcam equipment

These are the basic webcam equipment requirements:

* High-speed internet connection (at least 10Mbps)
* Microphone
* Webcam splitter

A quality, **high-speed connection** is crucial for webcamming. You don’t want any interruptions in the middle of your sessions. Obviously, a dial-up connection is out of the question since it’s too slow. Furthermore, you should consider using an ethernet cable rather than a Wi-Fi connection, as Wi-Fi tends to lose signal.

While you’re out buying your webcam, you might also want to check out some **microphones**. Although your webcam does have one built-in, it’s always better to buy a separate one. You can find a quality microphone for up to $100.

You’ll need a **webcam splitter** in order to stream to multiple websites at the same time. Unfortunately, your adult webcam software will only be able to stream to one site, so a splitter is crucial.

## Camgirl lighting equipment

Even if your room has substantial lighting, you will need to set up additional lights in order to make the video look as professional as possible. The best solution is to use a 3-point lighting system. You can buy a professional setup online, or you can even make one yourself.

Here’s what you’ll need:

* main light
* fill light
* backlight

The main light needs to be the brightest. Ultimately, the main light’s brightness will make dark shadows, which is why you need a fill light to get rid of them. Finally, the backlight adds a final touch of professionalism to the picture.

When you’re adjusting the brightness, you need to keep in mind that soft lighting is best. For that, you should use a softbox diffuser or an umbrella. As for the lightbulbs, opt for LED ones with about 1000 lumens. They’ll give you the soft lighting you need for a professional-looking stream.

***Professional camgirl tip:** If you really want to bring in the clientele, you can buy a backdrop or green screen. That way, you’ll make things more visually interesting.

## Wireless keyboard and mouse

Although buying a wireless keyboard and mouse is completely optional, it can do wonders when it comes to the quality of your performance. You won’t have to sit at your computer for the entire stream.

## Setting up your camming room

Once you buy the camming equipment, you can move onto setting up your camming room with the proper furniture and accessories. These things are also considered camgirl equipment, so choose wisely!

For starters, you’ll need a bed. That’s where most camgirls like to perform. However, if you prefer a sofa or a chair, go for it!

Next, you’ll need a table for your accessories. These will include any sex toys or other things you’d like to incorporate into your show. Basically, this part is totally up to you. You can add dildos, vibrators, butt plugs, handcuffs, etc. Practically anything that comes to mind. You don’t necessarily have to use them, but they may come in handy!

***Professional camgirl tip:** Consider placing a lamp on your table, and covering it with a sheer red scarf. You won’t block out the light, but you’ll add an air of romance to the show.
