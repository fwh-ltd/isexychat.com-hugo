### **Payment services/processors (operational outside U.S.)**

![](/images/Payment-Processors-for-Cam-Modeling-Industry-e1560171167427-1024x639.jpg)

There are several sites which provide payments outside of the U.S., but not in the U.S. Here are a few recognized ones:

* **Paxum**: An e-wallet service available to individuals outside of the United States. However, if you set up a business account in the United States you can use the service. A debit card option is available which allows you to spend or withdraw from your available funds. You can also transfer your money to a bank account via wire transfer, though that may not be a popular option in the United States.
* **Wire Transfer: Wire transfers are a popular way to move money to your bank account. However, banks charge “convenience” fees for money transfer transactions. Of these fees, wire transfers are often the largest with banks charging $25+ per transaction. As such, it is highly-recommended that U.S.-based webcam models avoid this payment option.**
* **ePayments**: ePayments does not support US-based models. However, if you are outside the US you can use a prepaid debit card to withdraw from an ATM or make purchases as you would for any credit card.
* **ePayService**: ePayservice is nearly identical in options to ePayments and can’t be used by US-based models. You can use a prepaid debit card to spend or transfer to a non-US bank account.
* **Cosmo Payment: Cosmo Payment is relatively new but growing quickly. They offer a prepaid debit card to spend anywhere. A credit or debit card is accepted as well as the option of withdrawing money from an ATM.**
* **Indiebill** (preferred by Indie Models): Indiebill is one of the most popular payment methods for independent adult models, providing the highest payout-percentage in the business. In addition to their payment service, they allow models to sell their own content—video clips, photo galleries, zip files, etc. A model can also accept payments for Skype shows and Snapchat. They also provide free personal websites for models.

While the above services are available, it is important for adult webcam models to **thoroughly read the payment processors’ policies and regulations prior to using them**. There are several policies which are not authorized in the United States as well as fees and additional considerations.

### **Gift cards**

While not a standardized form of payment through most sites, gift cards, especially Amazon Gift Cards, are becoming more popular today. Gift cards are frequently used by independent models because they provide:

* A discrete form of direct payment.
* Ease of purchasing most products anywhere in the world.
* An easy way to give tips and gifts.

Webcam sites that offer gift cards are limited, but gift cards are frequently accepted by independent models.

There are **a couple of downsides of using “Amazon gift cards” as a payment**. For example:

* Gift cards are not direct payments of money, so you can’t pay your bills, gas, rent, or mortgage payment.
* Amazon and other gift card companies expressly state in their terms and agreements that gift cards are not to be used as a form of payment. In fact, doing so can lead to suspension from the site, although this is rarely if ever enforced.

## **Payment Methods that should NOT be considered by Adult Performers**

![](/images/Payment-Methods-to-be-avoided-by-Cam-Models-e1560147499464-1024x640.jpg)

**PayPal**

PayPal is the largest e-wallet in the world, and it is not surprising that [new webcam girls](/how-to-become-a-cam-girl/ "How To Become A Cam Girl") will wonder why PayPal is a bad choice for processing transactions. The two biggest **reasons to not use PayPal** are:

* PayPal does not support the adult industry regarding payments, and you are at a higher risk for chargebacks.
* You are at a high risk of having your PayPal account suspended and any money you have in your account can be frozen.

### **Zelle or Venmo**

Zelle and Venmo are popular payment processing services that offer bank-to-bank transfers of money. While this might sound appealing, there is a strong possibility for both the recipient and the sender to be at risk of chargebacks and fraud.

Bank-to-bank services should be reserved for only people you know.

### **In-person payments (usually cash)**

It can be tempting to meet a viewer in-person to accept a cash payment. However, this is highly advised against. Meeting a viewer in person is the most dangerous way both physically and potentially financially to accept payment and should be done under no circumstances.

## **Wrapping up**

Becoming a webcam model can be a fun and profitable part-time job or career as long as you weigh all the options out there and pick up only those which are in your favor. Do a thorough research and pay special attention to the above webcam model pay options and make your own webcam modeling business seamless and prosperous.
