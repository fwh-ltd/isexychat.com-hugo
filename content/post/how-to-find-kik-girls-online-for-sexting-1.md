It’s one of those Friday evenings when you find yourself at home with nothing better to do. You don’t feel like going out but would love some fun, casual, no-strings-attached sexy time. So you reach out for your phone, fingertips on the go to start sexting. But hang on a second: where do you find sexting partners on a whim and that late at night? It’s not like you can post about it on Facebook. The answer is simple: Kik girls.

If you don’t have the slightest clue as to what on earth we’re talking about, don’t worry. Read on to find out more about how to sext on Kik and what makes it one of the best sexting and social media platforms on the market.

## **What is Kik, and what makes it special?**

First launched in 2010, Kik is a free instant-messaging app that builds on the likes of WhatsApp and Viber by including additional features more typical of social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Over the past few years, Kik saw a spike in popularity. As of May 2016, the app had around 300 million registered users worldwide.

What makes Kik truly stand out is its anonymity. To register for the service, you must enter your first and last name, email address, and date of birth and choose a username. However, you don’t have to enter a phone number, and whether or not you decide to upload a profile picture is entirely up to you. What’s more, neither the company nor other users can locate your account using any of your personal details other than your username. Moreover, all images, videos, and messages get automatically deleted soon after they are sent and only get stored on your device.

**Sexting on Kik: A how-to guide for beginners**

Here’s another great thing about Kik: you can chat with anyone, including strangers. You can use features such as Friend Finder and public groups to find and talk to people who aren’t on your contact list. What’s more, you can share unlimited photos and videos confidentially, which is great for sexting. The only question is: how do you find [strangers that would be open to sexting](https://isexychat.com/blog/online-random-chat-with-strangers/)?

## **How to find sexting partners on Kik**

### **Kik me!**

“Kik me” is an expression that was initially used to let your contacts on other social media platforms know that they can also reach you on Kik. People would tweet or gram “Kik me,” followed by their Kik username.

Nowadays, however, the expression is exclusively used by… sexters. So, to find girls looking to sext on Kik, simply type #kikme in the search bars of other social media platforms, copy their usernames, and send them a message on Kik.

### **Run a hashtag search**

In addition to #kikme, you can use other hashtags to find hot girls too. Just like Instagram, Kik lets you run hashtag searches. You can try any number of thematic hashtags, from #hotgirls and #sexting to #nudepics and #bdsm. As a general rule, however, the shorter and more specific your hashtag, the better the results will be.

**Become a member of public groups**

The Group Chat feature is another great way to find hot Kik girls looking for some action. Each group has a different topic and number of members, but all are public and open-access. Best of all, you are free to join as many as you like. Once you do that, you can start asking around for hot girls’ usernames.

### **Join Kik parties**

Unlike groups, you can only join a Kik Party if you have an invite. But if you don’t have one, don’t despair — you can create your own party and send out invites to hot girls you find via #kikme or Public Groups.

### **Search usernames**

As we already mentioned, the only way to look up someone on Kik who’s not on your contact list is through their username. But what if you don’t have it, or they’ve changed it? You can’t simply browse through all Kik members, either.

Don’t worry — here’s how to find girls on Kik if you don’t have their Kik sexting usernames. There are two ways: finder websites and internal apps.

### **Finder websites**

There are various finder websites where you can find Kik usernames. Each site has different features, so it might be a good idea to check out a few to get the best results.

[Kik Friend Finder](https://www.kikfriendfinder.co.uk/) is a great one, as it lets you narrow down your search by age group. [Kik Usernames](http://kikusernameslist.com/) and [Kik Base](https://www.kikbase.com/) allow you to see which users are currently online, increasing your chances of having a sexting session in real-time.

You should definitely check out [KikSexting](https://www.kiksexting.com/), which specializes in sexting and is guaranteed to connect you to like-minded individuals. You can also find tons of nudes there, many of which come with usernames. Some other great places to find sexting partners include [Kik Boys](https://kikboys.com/), [Kik Dirty,](https://kikdirty.com/) and [Kik Sexting Forum](https://www.sextingforum.net/forum/21-dirty-kik/).

### **Internal apps**

Kik comes with a great many internal apps. Best of all, they are all available free of charge. But why should _you_ care? Well, it just so happens that one of those apps, called Roleplay, could come in rather handy when looking for hot Kik girls to chat up.

Simply get the app and post about what you are looking for. Don’t be shy: the more straightforward you are, the better your chances of having girls reply to you.

Whether you are looking to join some of the many free Kik sexting groups or merely chat with your old friends and make new ones, Kik has so much to offer. You can have endless fun and enjoy unlimited hot sexting sessions and not have to worry about your anonymity and data confidentiality.
