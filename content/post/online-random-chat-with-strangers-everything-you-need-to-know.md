It is getting hard to remember what life was like before the internet. People used to talk face to face or call each other on the phone. It was possible to go days, weeks or months without interacting with a person back then. Schedules, work, and distance always seemed to interfere with staying up to date.

Dating before the internet was another story. It meant getting out of the house to go where other people were. The circle of people a person could reach out to was limited and relatively small.

The internet changed the way that everyone communicates. Distance is no longer an obstacle. The ways that you can meet people has grown and now your circle of acquaintances is much larger. There are plenty of different ways to meet someone who you would want to go out on a date with. You can also find people to talk to that share similar interests or problems.

The ability to connect with so many people has made some things better. There are plenty of relationships that began through online services. Friends and family that move away from each other can remain connected through social media and other internet websites. It is easier to share so much of your life on the internet and that is something to enjoy.

There are advantages of talking with strangers and disadvantages. Before anyone heads online to start online chatting with strangers, they need to consider a few things. The goal is to find people to talk to and possibly start relationships that mean much more than some random chat.

## Choose the Place to Chat

There are plenty of different ways to chat with someone on the internet. Finding the right chat program is very important when it comes to safely using the internet. The first step to finding the right chat program involves deciding who you want to chat with.

* If you want to chat with friends and family – When chatting with someone you know, there are many programs that allow for direct contact. Facebook, Skype, Instagram and many other websites require you to set up a profile and allow you to pick and choose who you chat with. While you still need to take care with what you say when talking to people you know, at least you have some trust that they are who they say they are.
* If you want to chat with strangers – When you want to chat with strangers, you also have plenty of online random chat sites to choose from. It is best to consider what type of person you want to start a chat with. Ask yourself some questions about what you want to narrow down the choices. Are you looking for people from a certain area, are you looking for someone to date or are you looking for someone to [engage in online sex chat](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/ "Chatrooms - Sex Chat")? It is okay to use several different random chat apps depending on how you feel on any given day.

When it comes to choosing the program for an online chat with strangers, you also have to choose the format you want. You can choose sites that allow for live webcam chat or you can find random text chat sites. The different sites all have different things to know about.

## Learn the Rules of Netiquette

The great thing about random chat with strangers is that it is anonymous. You can be whoever you want. You can create a story when you are chatting with someone who does not know you. That does not mean there are no rules. There are some basic things that everyone should follow when engaged in a [chat with random strangers](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/general-chat/ "iSexyChat - General Chat"). This is known as netiquette.

The number one rule of netiquette is politeness. You do not need to harass a stranger for no reason. You also need to treat the person you chat with as if they are a real person. Even though you have the protection of the anonymity of the internet, it does not change the rules of how you treat others. Remember the hellos and the goodbyes and the thank yous. Avoid using all capital letters as that is thought of as shouting. Treat an online conversation in the same way you treat an in-person conversation.

## Beware of Catfishing

While netiquette is a rule to follow, not everyone does it. There are many people who are not going to on the [online text chat sites](https://isexychat.com/ "iSexyChat") for nice purposes. They are there to take advantage of others. One technique is catfishing.

Catfishing refers to a person who makes up who they are. They are looking to create relationships with people by exaggerating themselves. They lie about who they are, what they look like and why they are on free random chat sites with strangers.

There are plenty of reasons someone engages in catfishing. It is often harmless. Some people just want to be someone different than they are in real life. There are also some people that want to start a relationship so they can take advantage of the other person in the future.

## Keep Personal Information Private

Online heartbreak often happens when a person finds out the stranger, they met was not honest about who they are or what they were after. The feelings that get hurt from online sex chat are just as real as they are when people break up in person.

## Never Forget Real Friendships

The friendships they have with the real people in their life can suffer if too much time is spent online.
