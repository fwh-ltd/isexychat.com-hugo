However, while the endgame is to have a fun time, the key to your safety – and the mystery – is to play by the rules of anonymous [online sexting](https://isexychat.com/ "iSexyChat"). Learning how to sext is as important as learning how to have actual sex. Experience is going to make you better at sexting and at the same time turn you and your partner on even more. So, when looking for a sexting partner keep these “anonymous” rules in mind. They’ll save you from the bad, the awkward, and maybe even more. Here is a sexting guide to keep your intimate conversation anonymous.

## **Hide the Tatts, Earrings, and Hair Color**

In the real world tattoos, earrings, different hair color, and other physical beauty highlights are a turn-on. So, when you’re sexting you know the topic of physical appearance will come up. But, when you are looking to find sexting partners online, do you really want a random stranger to know exactly what you look like? Sexting is a game, so have fun and turn it into one. Use your imagination to deliver a fantasy that will keep your actual appearance anonymous.

## **Keep “real” people, real far away!**

Oh, there is so much that can go wrong when you sext someone you know. For example:

* Those sexts can come out to other people you know.
* Emotions can get in the way.
* Revenge can be a killer if things don’t work out between the two of you.
* If _you_ know and your anonymous sexting partner finds out later, you’ve got some trouble on your hands.

So, when it comes to anonymous sexting, even if the person doesn’t know who you are when you start, there is a good chance they will find out later. After all, it can be hard to hide our mannerisms and speech patterns. They are just as telling as our body movements.

## **Be discreet with your location**

Okay, we all enjoy talking about where we live. But, to keep your sexting relationship strictly anonymous, try to keep out any identifiable information such as your town, city, and even your state. Above all, don’t give out your home address. Be careful with this because the nefarious stalkers out there happen to be pretty good at what they do, and you might not realize that you’ve even given your address away. Some examples of ways a person might try to get your address:

* A stalker might request to log into your email account because theirs is hacked and they “need” to send someone an important message.
* Your anonymous stalker may request money for something that will “save a life.” The postage stamps and return label can put you in a bad spot.
* Ask questions that prompt answers: what is your favorite local restaurant? Or, where did you go to school?

## **Keep your rendezvous digital**

Private sexting online can quickly grow into the urge to meet the person you are sexting. But, remember that as you are putting on a persona, so is the other person. So, when you decide to meet, you may not be meeting the person you thought. Whether your meeting experience is harmless or dangerous, making the move to meet your sexting partner can ruin the fun of [free online chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/ "iSexyChat - Chatrooms") and sexting in general.

## **Be careful about “I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.”**

It’s tempting to [send and receive pictures](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/trade-pics/ "Chatrooms - Trade Pics") and video. We all like to see a little skin. But you may not realize exactly how much you are showing. In the heat of the moment, you may have forgotten to move that piece of mail with your address that you tossed on your bed. Your work I.D. and uniform could be laying on the rack behind you. Or, family pictures could be hanging on the wall. By exposing yourself you could be inadvertently exposing your home and others whom you love.

## **Create a sexting alias**

Not everyone is comfortable going by a pseudonym, but when you are trying to have an [online random chat with strangers](/online-random-chat-with-strangers/ "Online Random Chat With Strangers") it’s better to have an alias. Sexting is about building a fantasy and that doesn’t stop with creating a pseudonym to fit your carnal persona. So, if you’re Jenny from California maybe you should be the Russian skier Nadiya from Sochi.

Your name is your identity, and with only a few small bits of information, your anonymous sexting partner can turn [online sex chat ](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/ "Chatrooms - Sex Chat")into a much less enjoyable encounter.

## **Keep your personal life to yourself**

Free online chatting sites are nice ways to sext and stay anonymous at the same time. However, if you start sharing personal information such as where you work, what sports you enjoy playing, and even what your day-to-day life is like, you are giving away a lot of information for a stalker to digest and research. People have a need to talk about their lives, and even while sexting, a slip of the tongue _(pun intended)_ can give away important details that reveal who you are.

## **Be Stealthy**

Everyone grew up wanting to be a ninja, so this one is not only insightful, but also fun. While we love to share what we had for dinner on Facebook or snap a picture of the sunset on Instagram, it’s also important to know that you can play online and still keep your anonymity.

* **Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Many people don’t realize that an I.P. address can be as responsive to your location as G.P.S. A VPN will create a location different from your actual location.
* **Sext in Incognito Mode: Using a web-browser’s incognito mode will allow you to browse online without worrying that your browser history and personal information is exposed or directly stored on the computer you are using.**

Anonymous online sexting should also mean safe sexting. But things don’t always go according to plan. Looking for sexting partners is a great way to have fun, relieve a bit of stress, and keep the carnal-mystery alive. But when you lose your amorous anonymity you may also lose other things like:

* The ability to be blackmailed if someone threatens to “out” you.
* The constant fear that your pictures, videos, and even sext messages will get out to the public.
* Embarrassing possibility for loved ones to see what you’ve been doing.
* Physical harm if your sexting partner is less the persona they put on and more the bad actor you didn’t expect.

Be flirty, be cute, but keep it safe. And if you have been compromised, that is not a secret you should hide. Tell someone.
