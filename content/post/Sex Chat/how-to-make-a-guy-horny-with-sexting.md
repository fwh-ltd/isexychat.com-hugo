Ah, who hasn’t dabbled in a sexting session or two in their lives? Pretty much everyone’s at least tried it. However, there’s a big difference between sexting as a way to spice up the relationship and sexting strangers online.

“Whoa, there, why would I sext strangers?” you might be wondering. Well, why wouldn’t you? Participating in an exciting, naughty sex chat will help you get your rocks off, and give you an incredible self-esteem boost. Not to mention, sexting is good for your overall skills. Sexting is an excellent way to branch out, see what’s out there, see which kinks might be ideal for you, and which ones are definitely not your cup of tea. It’s better to know that sooner rather than later. Plus, don’t lie — even the thought of sexting turns you on, doesn’t it?

Sexting allows you to have fun, get off, and experiment, without actually having to commit to anything.

## **How to dominate the chat and make him hard with sexting**

Sexting is all fun and games until you run out of things to say. In fact, that happens to many people, as keeping it 100% dirty is nearly impossible. And you know what? That’s fine! It’s alright to stumble and run out of ideas. You’re human!

But, sexting is only fun if all parties participate actively. So, while it might be OK to stumble, freeze, or say something stupid, it’s better if you don’t. Luckily, we have some great suggestions for naughty messages for him. Strap in!

## **How to talk dirty to a guy 101**

Because some people may have an issue sexting complete strangers, here are a few common rules to stick to.

### Be direct

How to talk dirty to a guy? Just do it! Be direct and don’t let your need for subtlety sway you away from your goal. After all, you want to get off, right? So, use direct language and send texts that will make him hard instantly. Being suggestive and coy isn’t the optimal way to get what you want, so go straight for the jugular.

“I want you. Right now.” is simple, straightforward, and it will get you where you need to be going. Remember, not many people are that great with hints. It’s better to be blunt.

Some people might have trouble [starting the sexting convo](/sexting-tips-for-beginners/ "Sexting Tips For Beginners"). Don’t worry; you don’t need a big intro, just tell your sexting partner what you want. Here are some examples of great simple conversation starters:

* I’m so wet right now.
* I just got out of the shower, and I’m still dripping wet, want to have some fun?
* What would you like to do to me?
* I’d love to feel your hard body against mine.

These are simple, but they’ll let you get started with a BANG!

### **Go for quality over quantity**

Don’t fall into the trap of typing huge paragraphs of text and getting lost in your own little conversation digressions. Keep it to the point. A well-crafted one-liner will be more effective than a massive block of text where you go on and on about the color of your underwear. While some might appreciate this, most will just want to know what you have underneath it. Try these zinger lines:

* I’m typing this one-handed.
* I had the dirtiest dream last night, would you like to hear about it?
* I’m wearing nothing but heels right now.
* I’ve been a bad girl, I truly deserve to be punished.
* Would you like to dominate me?

Some of these might sound cheesy or simple, but remember that in the throes of passion, cheesy just means effective. You’re not shooting for a Pulitzer here, just an orgasm.

### **Keep the conversation going**

Dynamics are fundamental in sexting. If you’re wondering [how to sext](/sext-online-like-a-pro/ "Sext Online Like a Pro") a guy without sounding like it’s your first time, just keep the conversation flowing. The golden [rule of sexting](https://isexychat.com/rules/ "iSexyChat - Rules") is to stick to what you’re comfortable with. So, start with that and work your way up (or down or in any other direction, really). It’s perfectly fine to say what you want and be clear about it, even if your desires don’t necessarily follow the same logic that the previous messages dictate. You can switch it up and move the conversation to topics you’re more comfortable with. Here’s how:

* That sounds fantastic babe, almost as good as you rubbing your hands all over my body.
* You’re making me so horny I can barely think. You’re so good to me.
* Tell me your filthiest fantasy. Want to hear mine first?

Sexting partners, even those you only sext with briefly, love to feel wanted and needed, so always aim for that. However, don’t neglect your needs.

### **Don’t be afraid to introduce new ideas**

[Sexting with strangers online](/online-random-chat-with-strangers/ "Online Random Chat With Strangers") can be tricky if you’re into some next-level kink. But that doesn’t mean you don’t get to enjoy sexting. It’s all a matter of finding the right partner. While kink negotiations are not to be taken lightly, you shouldn’t be afraid to introduce new ideas to your sexting partner. Just remember to go easy and keep it vanilla in the beginning.

Here are a few dirty talking lines to text to a man if you’re looking for a racier sexting convo. For those who like to dabble with pain play, bondage, and other various kinks, but are unsure how to steer the convo that way, try:

* I want to feel you deep inside of me while I scream from pleasure and pain.
* I want you to be as rough as you can. Give it to me good, I deserve it!
* I want you to bound and gag me, to have me begging for mercy, to make me desperate for touch.

#### **A few parting words**

When sexting, always remember that language matters. Dirty words provoke dirty imagination, which is really what you’re going for. Also, it’s essential to set boundaries and not cross them. Sexting is supposed to be enjoyable for everyone. Use descriptive language, but don’t go overboard and, most importantly — have some fun!
