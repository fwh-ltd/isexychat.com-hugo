Dirty roleplay is a wonderful way to spice things up. Who doesn’t like shedding their everyday persona for something kinkier, more free, or simply different? Roleplay chat rooms allow us to slip into another persona – be someone else for the night. Maybe you’ve always dreamed of seducing a teacher as an innocent pupil? Or you wanted to playout a doctor-patient fantasy? Perhaps you have some desires that are too wild to be executed in real life? Blood and gore turn you on, but you aren’t interested in actually making your fantasies a reality?

Either way, online roleplaying can be the ideal solution. Get your groove on from the comfort of your own home with sex roleplay online.

Before we dive into examples of just how kinky [adult roleplay online chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/roleplay-chat/ "Chatrooms - Roleplay Chat") can get, let’s get some facts straight. For the uninitiated, or those interested in proper definitions, let’s dig into the very essence of roleplaying.

## What is roleplay chat?

In simple terms, roleplaying is playing pretend. With roleplay, two or more partners decide to play out specific roles or characters. People often use roleplaying for various games, and it’s also a handy tool in psychotherapy. However, sex roleplay online has one goal 一 to get you off. Because imagination has no limits, you can be whatever or whoever you want. You can also do or achieve anything. Three-hour sex sessions are not a difficult feat with roleplaying. If you can imagine it, it can happen.

Roleplay chats can be used for innocent games, but they are more often used for dirty role play through text. Sex roleplay online is a great way to connect with likeminded people or spice up your relationship.

## Types of roleplay chats

As with anything else, people’s desires are vast and different. However, in a roleplay chat, you can always find someone willing to play along with your fantasy (probably because they share it).

Typically, we can divide types of roleplay chats into two big categories 一 fantasy and real-life. Although all of them are pure fantasy, of course. But if you’re dreaming of having steamy sex with a werewolf, real-life roleplay chat rooms won’t do you much good.

### Fantasy roleplay

All roleplaying is essentially character play. Both you and your partner assume a specific role that has particular characteristics, habits, interests, and desires. If you’re in a random roleplay chat, [chatting away with complete strangers](/online-random-chat-with-strangers/ "Online Random Chat With Strangers"), you’ll have to abide by your role and/or chat room rules. However, if you have a steady chat partner that you play pretend with regularly, you can develop your character and go “off script” so to speak.

Roleplay online chat has one rule (one primary rule, that is) – stick to the theme. If you’re in a Mario themed chat room, you can’t simply slip into a doctor/patient scenario. Your partner might not want to participate in that roleplay, and it’s simply rude to disrupt someone while they are on a roll.

So, stick to the theme. Thankfully, there are many, especially in fantasy play.

#### Anime

Anime doesn’t necessarily mean “fantasy,” as there are many animes that are non-fictional dramas, for example. Still, it is usually considered as “fantasy” due to the appearance and behavior of many anime characters.

So, find an appropriate chatroom if you’re interested in playing someone’s Orihime to their Ichigo. And, yes, Bleach sex roleplay chats are just scratching the surface.

#### Magic

Magic is a pretty broad term. It covers everything supernatural, paranormal, or sci-fi 一 from fairies and demons to aliens and stormtroopers. Magical roleplaying leaves a lot of room for imagination, but the most common trope is a combination of supernatural creatures and humans (be their one human weakness) or forbidden love. An angel and a demon getting it on? Is there anything hotter? With shows like Good Omens and Lucifer fueling secret desires of everyone who ever wanted to play with the devil (or at least a demon), there are plenty of people who will jump into a chat like this with you.

### Real-life roleplay

It goes without saying that real-life roleplay is based on real life. It can be anything from the boss/secretary dynamics to the ever-present mother-of-best-friend fantasy. Of course, each trope has many layers. The doctor-patient scenario can be very vanilla (if you’d like it to be). However, it can also be as wild and kinky as you and your partner would like. Let’s not forget how James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal forever changed the way we look at the boss/secretary dynamics with the movie Secretary. If you can’t get your boss to spank you over spelling mistakes on your own, you can find a chat partner who’d be more than willing to do so.

Real-life roleplay can also be romantic and based on sensual dramas, or dirty and kinky, based on fast-paced actions. As long as both partners (or all partners) are comfortable with the scenario, location, and general rules, you can chat your little heart out.

Some of the most famous real-life scenarios are the cheating scenario, the innocent/experienced dynamic, and power play (where one party has more or all the power in the relationship). Of course, plays on the famous Romeo and Juliet trope are also popular, as are other forbidden love scenarios.

## Roleplay chat tips

A lot of beginners often ask for roleplay sexting examples, as a way to see what they should or shouldn’t do. One of the first rules of roleplay is that you feel comfortable and respect your partner’s guidelines and/or limits.

### Pick something you’re comfortable with

If you have no idea what a school teacher does, and you don’t feel comfortable with the role, don’t pick that fantasy to roleplay. You won’t be able to set the scene or play out specific scenarios. This is more important for fantasy roleplay because it has more rules. You can’t be a sexy, smoldering vampire if you don’t know heck about vampires, right?

### Pick something you know well (or want a lot)

It’s logical that you choose a role that you know well. Alternatively, you can pick a role that turns you on the most. It doesn’t necessarily have to be something you’re an expert in. After all, you don’t have to be a real judge to punish that low-life criminal with some kinky spanking. But you have to want it.

### Set rules/guidelines

Before you dive into the roleplay, set limits or rules with your partner. Most chat rooms will have guidelines or rules, and even a moderator that will police what others do/write. Respect the boundaries of other participants and set your own hard limits and ground rules.

### Stay in character

This tip is a given, but stay in character! There’s nothing worse than slipping into your everyday persona while chatting about having sex during a meteor strike on a planet far, far away.

### Don’t go overboard with images

While images can help you set the scene or a location, it’s best not to go overboard. After all, roleplay is about imagination and words. Some chat rooms even consider images to be a cop-out and don’t allow them. That’s why it’s vital that you check the rules before chatting.

### Fantasy stays a fantasy

Lastly, you must always remember that roleplaying has nothing to do with real life. Although it’s normal that you make a connection with your chat partner, a roleplay relationship is a fantasy relationship. It doesn’t hold merit in real-life.

Roleplay is meant to be fun, easygoing, and to let you explore your fantasies, no matter how wild some of them may be.
