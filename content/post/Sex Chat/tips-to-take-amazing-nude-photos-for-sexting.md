We’re sure your selfie game is strong, but do you know how to take nudes? We all strive to look as good as possible when taking a pic, but when it comes to sexting photos, you can’t exactly hide behind clothes or use them as a distraction.

Now, of course, there’s no need for you to hide your gorgeous body! Still, there are ways to elevate your sexting game.

## **Nude sexts — the future of sexting**

With the technology going full speed ahead, everything changes in the blink of an eye. While our grandparents exchanged love letters, today, [people use sex chats](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/ "Chatrooms - Sex Chat") and send nudes to connect with potential partners.

To some, this might seem like the death of romance, but if you think your grandparents didn’t send each other dirty letters, you’re in for a rude awakening.

So, with so many potential partners just a few clicks away, it’s only natural to want to take your nude selfie game to the next level. Luckily, there are a few simple things you can do to make sure your nudes are always banging!

## **Sexting selfies 101 — the best tips and tricks on how to send nudes**

### **Safety first**

Now, we’re all about steamy [sex chats with strangers](/online-random-chat-with-strangers/ "Online Random Chat With Strangers") and exchanging hot nudes. However, as always, safety has to come first.

Sending a boob shot or a dirty close-up probably won’t damage your life, integrity, or make a real problem. Still, if you have tattoos, birthmarks, or any other easily identifiable features, it’s best to keep them away from your nude sexts.

The basic rule is — don’t send nudes, especially those that include your face, to people you can’t trust. Sex chats with strangers are exhilarating and feel like a real adventure precisely because you have no idea who’s on the other side. Yet, that also means that they might not be as trustworthy as you’d like them to be.

### **Take your time**

Now that we’ve covered our bases, here are some technical tips on how to take a perfect nude selfie.

First of all, remember that there’s no such thing as a candid nude photo. So, don’t rush the process and take some time to make sure that everything is perfect. You might have to pose a bit, try different positions, angles, ideas, etc. Until you’ve tried them all, you won’t know which are perfect and which ones are less than flattering.

### **Give it several tries**

If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again. Don’t feel bad if you don’t get the perfect shot on your first try. More importantly, don’t think that your body isn’t beautiful just because you took a few awkward pics. [When you’re sexting](/sexting-tips-dos-and-donts/ "Sexting Tips Do's and Dont's") and exchanging nudes, confidence is everything. You radiate when you’re confident, so don’t forget to strike both a pose and an attitude.

Play with your surroundings, lingerie, pose, and angles. Eventually, you’ll get that perfect shot. In fact, after a while, you’ll realize that almost any shot is beautiful — as long as you stick to some basic rules on how to frame it.

### **Lighting matters**

Do you know that saying, “No one looks good under fluorescent lighting?” While not necessarily true, as we’re sure some people look good all the time, lighting is something you should seriously consider when taking nudes.

Harsh, intense light won’t be your friend. You should also avoid overhead lighting and the already mentioned fluorescent lighting. These can wash you out or create shadows that are anything but flattering.

If you want your skin to glow and your curves to catch the attention of your sexting partner right away, go for dim, multi-source lighting or natural light. Taking pics on a slightly cloudy day next to a source of natural lighting is your best bet, as the pictures will come out beautiful.

Still, most nudes are sent in a hasty sexting frenzy in the middle of the night. So, work with what you have and make the best of it.

### **So do angles**

Angles sometimes matter even more than lighting. It’s all about what you want to feature in your selfie.

You can go for a dirty close-up or a wide shot of your entire body (_sans_ face, of course). However, if you’re wondering how to take a boob pic that will look both sexy and aesthetically pleasing, or how to take the best whole-body nude, the answer lies in the angles.

Sideboob, for example, is erotic and enticing, especially if you play with shadows. More often than not, though, nudes feature more than just one body part, so a side shot might not work well if you’re trying to showcase all your assets. If you want a full-body shot, take a pic from above or below, depending on what you’re trying to capture.

Other angles can also be fun, but they aren’t as effortless. For example, bending over and getting a shot from behind might seem like a hassle (and it is), but it’s not impossible. What’s more, the end result is a gorgeous pic that’s both erotic and filthy.

### **Check yourself**

Even if you’re not going to feature your face in your nudes, check yourself in the mirror. Of course, if you’re comfortable enough to share your face with the world, then check your makeup and facial expressions as well. However, if you aren’t (like most people), you should still check your pose and see what it looks like.

Sometimes, we think we look erotic and inviting, but we end up featuring the wrong body part. So, do one final check before you send a selfie that accidentally features your elbow at an awkward angle (or worse).

### **Don’t be shy**

Photographers often say, “make love to the camera.” What they mean by that is — don’t be shy. Don’t be afraid to expose yourself as you would to a lover. Work with the camera and flirt with it — show it your best features, poses, and attitudes.

### **But leave something to the imagination**

People often wonder if nudes have to involve doing the full Monty. Of course not. Sending a pic where you’re semi-nude or in hot lingerie will be just as appreciated.

In the end, you have to do what you’re comfortable with. After all, sending someone a close-up shot of your labia is a bold move — may be even too bold for some. It’s straight-up dirty and best reserved for really steamy sessions.

If you’re only just starting your sex chat with someone-, it’s perhaps better to start slow. Imagination is a powerful thing, and it’s always best to leave them wanting more.

### **A few parting words**

Sending nudes is exciting and liberating. You get to share your gorgeous body with your sexting partner and enjoy whatever they send in return. However, always be mindful of potential consequences. It’s all fun and games until someone ends up on a revenge porn site. So, be careful and have fun!
