### But don’t be super mysterious

In a cybersex chat room, you’ll meet strangers who are all looking for some good time — just like you. Nevertheless, that makes the introductions a bit awkward, especially if it’s your first time.

Just like with dating, you have to test the territory a bit by connecting with the person you’re chatting with. Jumping right into cybersex is a big no-no — you don’t know anything about them at all.

Not only does that mean they could be a creep, but it could also make the experience extremely dull. When you don’t know what they like, and they’re not interested in learning more about you — no one will get to orgasm any time soon.

### Sexting in chat rooms is especially hard

Unless you’re into writing and know how to manipulate your words into steamy lines of pleasure, you’re going to have a hard time figuring out what to say. In that case, why not opt for some other media you could use instead?

Although many people bash voice messages, they are quite appealing, especially if you have a nice voice, and your moans are superbly intense. Besides that, it’s easier to express what you want when you’re caught up in the moment. When you have to keep pressing pause to type out a message and cannot find the right phrase, you’re bound to lose interest. With voice messages, you already know what you want and can freely say it!

## Key tips for incredible cybersex

### Remember that consent exists even in the online world

If the person you’re chatting with doesn’t want to do something, don’t force them. Make sure both of you are on the same page and that you want the same thing.

### Explore your fantasies but take your time

Running against a ticking clock never made anyone all hot and bothered, or at least, it doesn’t work great in chat rooms. You don’t know well the person you’re chatting with yet, so you ought to take your time to see what they’re interested in, what they like, etc. — what they’re all about.

At the same time, don’t forget to play around with your own fantasies. Tell them how you’d like them to touch you, kiss you, or “handle” you. The cybersex world is all about pleasure. Don’t be afraid to delve into the hidden corners of your mind and fish out all the things that make you scream with desire.

### Be as creative as possible — and a bit of a tease

The anticipation that comes right before having sex is the second-most enjoyable part, so don’t rob yourself of it. Be a bit of a tease — cybersex allows it!

Work on that sexual tension by not rushing through any steps. For example, don’t just say you’re removing your clothes; talk about what you’re wearing and how the fabric feels against your skin. Mention how it’s slowly slipping off, revealing your smooth skin and a burning desire. Let your creativity flow — your orgasm will follow!

### Keep your identity hidden

When it comes to cybersex, [you can use photos](/tips-to-take-nude-photos-for-sexting/ "Tips To Take Nude Photos For Sexting"), [emojis](/emoji-sexting-ideas/ "Emoji Sexting Ideas"), voice messages, and more to raise the sexual tension. However, whatever you do, don’t reveal your identity. It’s highly unlikely you’re ever going to meet this person in real life. Besides, without knowing for sure who’s behind that kinky username, you could fall prey to all sorts of scoundrels.

[To stay safe while having cybersex](/anonymous-sexting-101/ "Anonymous Sexting 101"), never take photos of your face or show it in a video. Additionally, keep the information you share with the person on the lowest level possible. Sure, you can talk about your fantasies, but avoid mentioning the part of town you live in.

## Final thoughts

Cybersex is a lot of fun, especially when you take the time to learn more about the person you’re chatting with and what they’re all about. It’s all in the anticipation and rising tension — those two things practically guarantee an earth-shaking orgasm.

Besides, there’s a lot of fish in that sea — you don’t have to limit yourself to just one partner. The beauty of cybersex in chat rooms is that it allows you to change partners and explore what you really like!
