There is more to a sensual experience than the touch of soft skin. In fact, breaking away from a warm embrace can actually stimulate your hormones and improve vigor when it comes to the actual bedroom. Yes, we’re talking sexting.

Sexting is all about creating a tantalizing world to “tease” out your inner inhibitions. In many ways, lesbian txt provides a way to express what you are really looking for in bed, yet may be uncomfortable talking about or exploring with a physical partner. Lesbian sexting offers the chance to experiment and explore. The added benefit is that anyone from timid to aggressive can learn to play. Sexting can help a woman break from her mold as well as teach another to transform aggressive to sensual.

While lesbian sexting can offer a new element to a relationship, there is a learning curve. But, that’s why we’re here. Below are 12 fun sexting tips for beginners in the area of lesbian sexting. Enjoy!

## 1. It’s Okay to be Dirty

“I want to slide my tongue down your…” and “gently tug on your pert nipple…” We could go on with lesbian sexting examples all day. But the fact is, discovering how you get a wet-rise out of your online sexting partner is the fun part.

Lesbian sexting is as much about turning yourself on as your partner. And, let’s face it, lesbian dirty talk turns us all on. Though, when it comes to dirty, we have a few tips to keep the mood running all night:

* **Don’t be basic**: Sexting examples such as, “I want to take your shirt off,” lack the tease your partner may want to hear. Instead, “My fingers will slide along the inner curve of your bare thigh as I tickle the buttons of your shirt undone with my tongue.”
* **Be specific**: Details matter, regardless how curiously dirty things get, let your partner know what you want to do or feel. “I want to feel the warmth of your wetness as you rest on my chin.”
* **Pay attention to the signs**: Listen for or pay attention to your partner’s sexted response. If your partner seems turned on, then go deeper. If not, then try another style of dirty talk.

Whether you are sexting or into lesbian phone chat, being dirty is all about imagery. Much like a great writer or actor can bring you into the moment, you shouldn’t hold back on providing the full experience.

## 2. Sexting is Empowering

If you are shy or timid, there is a [steep curve to sexting](/sexting-makes-you-feel-empowered/ "Sexting Makes You Feel Empowered"). Sexting is like keeping a personal journal. You can write whatever you feel; whatever is turning you on without concern of regret. Sexting is a personal moment where you express what tickles your most sensitive areas.

Trust us, the more you drop talk of flicking your tongue, feeling moisture on your fingertips and scratching your partners back, the easier those words will follow and the more powerful those words will make you feel. Thus, when thinking of [things to say during sexting](/5-amazing-steps-for-sex-chat-success/ "5 Amazing Steps For Sex Chat Success"), try to strike a strong sexual connotation and break the mold of your physical self.

After all, everyone enjoys both being thrown against the wall, as well as being the one doing the throwing.

## 3. Tease your Partner into feeling Sexy

One of the keys to lesbian dirty chat is making your free chat sexting partner feel sexy through your words.

So, when you tell your partner that her “lips make you quiver,” or her “eyes cause you to shed inhibition,” what she hears is, “I’m sexy.” Helping your partner feel sexy is a great way to help you and your partner feel at ease and willing to explore dirty, discreet, and lustful sexting.

Here are a few tips to keep your lesbian chat sexting partner feeling sexy:

* **Be genuine**: No one feels sexy when they think you aren’t being real. So, be honest and focus on the beauty you enjoy in your partner. Just because you are relative strangers, doesn’t mean you can’t be genuine.
* **Be specific**: Phrases such as, “You are so hot,” may be nice to hear once in a while, but when it comes to feeling sexy, you want details. Is it how she bites her lips when nervous, how her eyes seem to change color when she looks at you, or the soft curve of her neck when she turns away from you?
* **Ask questions**: If you want to know if your partner feels sexy by what you say, then ask. Trust us, if she responds with anything other than a positive response, you might want to reconsider your approach.

## 4. Play Respectfully

You might want to talk about how wet your panties are, or how hard you want your ass slapped, but not everyone does. When it comes to sexting, one of the most important [sexting tips for beginners](/sexting-tips-for-beginners/ "Sexting Tips For Beginners") is to play respectfully.

Much like telling your partner she is beautiful; you also don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable either by what you say or the timing of when you say it.

For example, you might get horny sexting in the break room at work, but your partner may not. You may want to use offensive names, but those same names might make your partner feel angry or turned off.

To play lesbian sex talk respectfully you should talk about how to play the game. Take from the BDSM community and stick with a safe word(s). When things are getting too uncomfortable or the timing is off, a safe word like, “Love you hon,” may mean—this isn’t doing it for me.

## 5. Sexting is Consensual

Consent when it comes to sexting is no different than sex in person. So, before you take that dive and text your partner, remember to check the time. This is another good place where keywords can play a role, “Hey, are you feeling good right now?” might be the precursor to your sexting rendezvous. Now, if you’re both already enjoying a lesbian sexting site, it’s safe to assume that your partner is ready for some sexy time, but if your sexting partner is at work and you want her to log on, you should respect her when she says, “no.”

Consent is also, of course, your partner’s willingness. Does your partner prefer to ease into sexting with clear boundaries? Is your partner okay with sexting in public places such as a coffee shop? Is it okay to send nude selfies? While some will understand their partner’s consent level, others may need to communicate beforehand.

## 6. Turn to Words Your Partner Likes

Not all dirty talking lesbians use those infamous “B” and “C” words. In fact, many probably stay away. There is a good chance that imagery will be important for everyone. But how you use it may differ in your sexting fun. Dirty talk can be simply that—dirty. It can also be coy, elusive, teasing, and playful. Some of this is understanding your partner, while at other times you can ease into the more aggressive talk.

Frequently, sexting tips for girls will include personalizing your sexting to your partner. Try to gauge how your partner responds to things you say. To be fair, knowing what to say while sexting can be a bit clunky at first. After all, if you haven’t sexted before, your sexual experiences have probably been more physical than emotional. So, when you [visit free lesbian chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/lesbian-chat/ "Chatrooms - Lesbian Chat"), use this time to see how others sext.

You can also ask questions, like: “Where do you want me to touch you?”

## 7. Turn Off Autocorrect

When spell-check was created it’s safe to assume the autocorrect-techies didn’t have sexting on their mind—at least when it came to work. So, while passionately playing lesbian dirty talk, you might want to pay attention to your device’s autocorrect.

While you may want to “lick your quivering flesh,” you definitely don’t want autocorrect to display, “lick your quivering fish.” While it might be funny and worthy of an online screenshot, autocorrect can be a huge mood-breaker. So, before entering lesbian chat sites or picking up your kink on your smartphone, take the time to disable autocorrect.

## 8. Awkward is Okay

The good thing sexting does is takes away your non-words such as, “uh, ah, umm.” The bad thing is when you first start out, all other words may seem just as awkward. That’s purely because you just don’t know what to say and don’t want to sound silly. Don’t worry. Over time, you and your sexting partner will become more confident. In the meantime, try these tips:

* **Forgiveness**: You and your partner are probably going to say some funny and ridiculous things. But, forgive and forget as you learn what does work.
* **Pay attention while visiting free lesbian chat rooms**: Hey, if you’re going to learn about lesbians talking dirty to each other, then learn from the best.
* **You don’t need to stick to lesbian sexting quotes**: Sexting is about what works for you, so just because you read a quote doesn’t mean the moment always fits.
* **Practice**: Over time, practice makes perfect.

## 9. Use Your Questions Wisely

If you join a lesbian chat online, you may feel compelled to ask a lot of questions. “What turns you on?” or “Is it okay to talk like this?” Sure, questions are good, but when you overdo it, too many questions can break the mood.

![](/images/Ask-Wise-Questions-in-Online-Chat-e1560010298646.jpg)

Sexting is about exploration, so learning how to ask questions can be just as important as asking them. So, instead of “What turns you on?” you can ask, “I’m nibbling on your ear, and sliding my hand around to your stomach, where would you like me to end?”

So, while questions are good, you don’t want them to get in the way of a kinky moment. Ease yourself into the conversation and turn your sexting into the question rather than asking a question to start sexting.

## 10. Don’t forget Sweet Nothings

We all remember Jan Brady on “The Brady Bunch” talking about her older sister—Me, me, me. Well, no one likes it when their partner is all about their self. So, understand your partner’s needs and play to her turn-ons. This will show your partner that you care about how they feel which promotes the euphoria of sexy.

Like small nothings whispered into an ear, sending flirty and fun sexting notes can be a great way to get the juices flowing. For example, “I just bit my lip thinking about you and want to return the favor.” Another fun way to sext is by bringing up old sexting memories— “Remember when we were sexting about that villa in Italy and the beach. What did you want me to do?”

## 11. Naked Selfies Beware

Ah, those fun and revealing selfies. It always seems like people enjoy sending them more than receiving. It’s all about the voyeuristic human urge. Sexting nude selfies can be fun in the right moment and with the right partner, but it can also be a bit riskier than you expect especially if you join a free chat with girls. After all, there is no guarantee those pics stay private.

![](/images/Sending-Nude-Selfies-e1560010363874.jpg)

So, whether security or an inadvertent moment, think before you send off a naked picture of you cuddling with a Teddy bear.

Now, we’re not saying you shouldn’t send nudes to each other, just have a plan before doing so.

## 12. Take the Time to Practice

You knew this was coming and it’s been touched on a little. But practice does make perfect and that is why it is so important to reiterate. A year from now, you will sit back and read some of your earlier sexting messages and just laugh.

But, much like physical dating and initial sexual encounters, with online sexting, you need to learn what works for you and what works for your partner. Then you have to figure out how to put that all together. [Visiting a free lesbian chat room](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/lesbian-chat/ "Chatrooms - Lesbian Chat") is a great example of this as you watch [what the seasoned pros say](/sext-online-like-a-pro/ "Sext Online Like A Pro") compared to the newbies.

[Sexting chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/ "iSexyChat - Chatrooms") are a great way to later enhance your sexual encounters in the bedroom.
