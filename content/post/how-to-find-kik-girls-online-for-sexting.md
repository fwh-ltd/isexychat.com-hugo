When it comes to [sexting tips for beginners](/sexting-tips-for-beginners/ "Sexting Tips For Beginners"), the number one is definitely to find a willing partner or partners. However, while there’s a lot of platforms out there that can provide an opportunity, not all of them are strictly sex-based. Platforms like Kik are an excellent place for those looking for a free chat with girls, but how do you find sexy girls who are interested in sexting? You can’t proposition just anyone, right?

Sexting can be a thrilling adventure or an utter disaster. It’s really what you make of it. So, to avoid a colossal crash-and-burn here’s a quick guide on how to find Kik girls online for sexting.

## **What is Kik and why do people like it?**

For the uninitiated, Kik is a relatively new platform for messaging. It’s everything that the new generation expects from a social media platform — quick, easy to use, anonymous, and free. It’s the perfect combination of simple messaging applications such as Viber or WhatsApp and more elaborate platforms like Facebook.

The number one advantage of Kik is that you can chat with anyone. People often use it to talk with their friends, but Kik also features options such as friend finder and public groups, which allow people to chat with strangers who aren’t in their contact list. And so, Kik proves itself as the haven for sexting as it gives you a chance to branch out and find sexy Kik groups and meet girls on Kik.

## **How to find Kik girls for sexting**

Because Kik paid attention over the past decade or so, it made its chat platform accessible for texting (and sexting), as well as photo and video sharing. So with Kik, sexting is a piece of cake. However, finding girls on Kik isn’t as easy. Because Kik is so versatile, when you download it and start your adventure of sexting, you have several options on how to find sexy Kik groups and hot girls for sexting.

### **The good, old faithful “Kik me”**

“Kik me” is an expression that started off fairly innocently. It was a way to let your friends know they can reach you over a new platform — Kik. People used to tweet or Instagram “kik me,” followed by their Kik username. You’ll notice that only a selected group of people do that now — the sexters. So, to find girls online for sexting, you can search other social media platforms for “#kikme” to get their usernames.

### **Search public groups**

Kik is an anonymous platform that opens up a whole world of possibilities. You can chat with anyone about anything without being obligated to give a name, profile picture, verify an email, or comply with any other security measures that other platforms insist on.

These advantages really come in handy with the Group Chat feature. Public groups vary both in the topic and number of members, and they are a sure-fire way to find girls for sexting. You can join as many as you like and ask for sexy girls’ usernames, or you can simply see which username other people found. Be a bit sneaky and use other people’s hard work to your advantage — just add the girls after someone else found them!

### **Party on Kik**

Aside from public groups, Kik also offers the option of Kik Parties. Anyone can join a Party if they have an invite. Alternatively, you can make your own party and invite the girls you found via the Public Groups feature.

### **Hashtags**

Much like the more popular Instagram, Kik allows you to do a hashtag search. To find hot girls on Kik simply search “#hotgirls” or any other variation. If you’re looking for something specific, you can use a longer hashtag (#sendnudes, #bondagegirlsonkik, etc.). However, the shorter and more to the point, the better your results will be.

### **Usernames**

Knowing someone’s Kik username is a sure way to find them and start chatting with them. However, you can’t precisely guess someone’s username, as it can be anything and they can change it at any time. Therefore, you might need some help there.

### **Finder websites**

The best features of Kik are internal apps and additional websites. Although Kik doesn’t let you browse all members (which would be ludicrous anyway), it does allow you to find usernames with the help of various websites.

When you aren’t feeling up to racking your brain and coming up with suggestive Kik usernames to search, try a website like [KikFriendFinder](https://www.kikfriendfinder.co.uk/females "KikFriendFinder"). This website’s main feature is that it allows you to search by age groups.

Another fantastic website is [KikSexting](https://www.kiksexting.com/ "KikSexting"). If you’re only looking for a sexting partner (or a few), this website will give you access to likeminded people. What’s more, it’s also a great source of nudes that are often followed by usernames. So, easy pickings!

Username finder websites vary when it comes to features. For example, [Kik Base](https://www.kikbase.com/ "Kik Base") and [Kik Usernames](http://kikusernameslist.com/ "Kik Usernames") allow all users to see who’s online at that moment, which makes a quick sexting session that much easier to arrange. Other websites, such as [Kik Sexting Forum](https://www.sextingforum.net/forum/21-dirty-kik/ "Kik Sexting Forum"), [Kik Dirty,](https://kikdirty.com/ "Kik Dirty") and [Kik Boys](https://kikboys.com/ "Kik Boys"), are like the sexting central and the perfect place to find your sexting partners.

### **Internal apps**

Kik has a lot of internal apps that are available for free. One of them will come in handy when it comes to sexting — Roleplay. You can post about what you’re looking for and be as straightforward as you’d like. In fact, the more open you are about what you want, the better your chances of actually getting it. A good Roleplay post can get you all the girls you ever dreamed about sexting.

### **A few parting words**

When it [comes to sexting](/sexting-tips-dos-and-donts/ "Sexting Tips Do's and Dont's") — Kik is your oyster. As long as you’re upfront about what you’re after, and you know where to look, you’ll find plenty of willing sexting partners. Nude Kik groups, open sexy groups, kinky usernames, and finder websites will all prove valuable in your search for hot girls who’ll sext with you. So, good luck, and have fun!
