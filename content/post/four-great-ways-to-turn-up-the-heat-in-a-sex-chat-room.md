Free sex chat rooms are great places to explore your sexuality and meet other kinky individuals looking for fun and games. Nevertheless, talking to strangers can be somewhat unnerving even at the best of times, to say nothing of sexting. To make sure you always have a great dirty line up your sleeve, here are some tips on how to keep the fire in your [live sex chat](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/) burning.

## 1. Be the Perfect Mix of Respectful and Direct

Nothing gets us going more than a man or woman who knows what they want and how to get it. Especially if what they want is us. However, in the heat of the moment and under the false sense of security that comes with anonymous sex chat, it may be easy to lose our healthy sense of boundaries.

Therefore, make sure to always ask for consent, be respectful, and watch out for warning signs that the other person may be beginning to feel uncomfortable. Then, spice it all up with a hearty dose of straightforwardness. Be open about what you like, what you want, and how you want it — hold nothing back.

You’d be surprised how much people dig someone they can both trust _and_ have unlimited kinky time with!

Sex Chat Examples:

* “I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but I’m simply _dying_ to get down on you. Imagining how you taste down there has been keeping me awake all night.”
* “Just say, ‘Yes,’ and I’d give you the hardest pounding you’ve had in your life.”
* “Don’t mean to come off the wrong way, but I can think of a few things I would do with that fine piece of ass of yours.”

## 2. Pay Genuine Compliments

Let’s face it — we are all a bit shallow and a tad full of ourselves. Catering to our vanity is usually a foolproof way to get under our skin. And what better way to do that than paying lots of compliments?

Both in real life and [free sexting chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/), we all appreciate compliments. Make no mistake: men, women, and everyone in between — we all love being told how hot we are. Don’t think that just because you are sexting with a man, you should not compliment him on the size of his biceps or other body parts further down south.

That’s not as simple as it sounds, though. If you compliment your sexting partner, you better mean it. Most of us can see through artifice even [when chatting anonymously online](https://isexychat.com/blog/anonymous-sexting-101/). Therefore, make sure that your compliments are both realistic and heartfelt.

### Sex Chat Examples:

* “Wow. I mean WOW. That sure is among the biggest ones I’ve seen — and I’ve seen my fair share.”
* “Your eyes are intoxicating. I just can’t get enough of them.”
* “You know what? You are not only sexy but also have a great sense of humor! It’s been a while since someone’s made me laugh so hard.”

## 3. Play Hard to Get

Ah, the oldest trick in the book. But don’t roll your eyes just yet — there is a reason why everyone’s been doing it ever since pre-school days. It’s because it _works_.

Now, you may think that’s unfair, but don’t blame it on us. It’s human psychology 101. We’ve probably been hardwired this way from before we first went mammoth-hunting.

So, quit whining and start acting! Approach someone you like, pique their interest, tease them a little, and then back off. Have them go after you for a while, but don’t forget to feed them a line of encouragement here and there. They say the chase is better than the catch, and you will see that for yourself all too soon!

Sex Chat Examples:

* “Yeah, I’m not too sure about that.” (Ouch!)
* “Is that all you’ve got? I’m sure you can do better.”
* “You almost had me at _blowjob_. How about you do that again, but this time go slower and in greater detail? Do it well, and I just might have something for you in return.”

## 4. Don’t Miss a Beat

What do music, poetry, your heartbeat, and great conversation have in common? Well, they are all about rhythm and pace. Skip a beat, and you can ruin the whole thing.

Believe it or not, the same applies to sex chat conversation. To get it right, you need to let yourself go with the flow. Think of it as a couple’s dance: you need to always be in sync with both the music and your partner.

So, how do you make that happen? It’s actually very simple: don’t just throw in over-rehearsed pick-up lines and trite compliments. Instead, use your brain and come up with original questions and answers that are appropriate to the conversation and your chat room partner. Don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be anything genius — but it has to be _relevant_.

Also, don’t overthink it. Just because a conversation is about sex does not mean that the rules are that much different from regular dialogue. Sit back, relax, and try to act normal. You’d be pleasantly surprised by the results.

### Sex Chat Examples:

* Your partner: “I think I’m going to head off to bed now.”
* You: “May I join you?”


* Your partner: “I had a really long day today.”
* You: “I can make it longer but also infinitely more pleasurable.”
