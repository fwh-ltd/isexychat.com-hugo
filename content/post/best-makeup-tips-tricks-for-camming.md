Whatever you do, you should always try to give it your all, right? [Being a successful cam girl](/amazing-tips-for-successful-webcam-modeling/ "Amazing Tips For Successful Webcam Modeling") requires more than just sitting in front of a camera. You have to have great content, engage and entice your audience, and attract as many viewers as you can. That’s why it’s crucial that you look the part.

## Cam model tips for sexy cam girls

What are the qualities of the best cam show? If you’re wondering how to be a good cam girl, the answers are rather simple. However, there are many of them, so let’s start with the basics. Your appearance is vital to your success. After all, people like pretty things — that’s why they tune in. You have to sell them the fantasy and give them what they came for.

## The number one rule of webcam make-up

When you’re doing a cam show, you want the viewers to like what they see. Therefore, unless that’s your shtick, you won’t go live while looking like you just rolled out of bed. You’ll do your face and hair, put on some frisky, flirty outfit, and strut around.

When it comes to make-up, you have plenty of options. However, make sure to remember one crucial thing — make-up doesn’t look the same in different lighting conditions.

If you’re putting on make-up to go on a brunch with your girlfriends, you need natural lighting. So, by all means, sit at your vanity while you do your make-up. However, when you’re putting on make-up for a cam show, checking it in your vanity won’t do the trick. It will look completely different under the harsh lighting that you use for filming. So, make sure to check your make-up on your web camera before you start the live show.

When doing make-up for a cam show, make sure you check exactly how you look on your web camera before you actually get started, because the difference can be staggering.

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. What kind of make-up and what types of looks are the best for cam shows? Check out our tips for successful webcam modeling.

### Glowing skin

It’s essential that your skin looks soft, well-groomed, and taken care of. That’s why you need to keep it moisturized. Just because your viewers can’t touch your skin that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be delicate and smooth. What’s more, your gorgeous skin will invite the viewers to want to touch it, which is the end goal, after all. That’s how you get private shows, girl!

Of course, moisturizing and maintaining the healthy glow of your face is crucial as well. So, apply day and night creams and take good care of yourself — it will pay off.

### Exquisite tan

It doesn’t matter what your skin type and color are — porcelain, fair skin looks just as beautiful as the deep, chocolate one does. All tones are gorgeous and enticing, especially when you show a lot of skin. What does matter is that your face matches your body. So, when applying make up, make sure you have the right foundation or BB cream that won’t make you look like someone stuck your head on someone else’s body.

We all have our make-up routines, but here’s what works well, no matter what you like or look like.

#### Don’t melt under the lights — prime your skin

Because you have to have stellar lighting in your cam area, you have to make sure your make-up is durable enough to withstand the additional heat. So, after moisturizing, don’t forget to put on some primer. And, while on the subject of keeping your make-up fixed, we also have to mention setting sprays or powders. Those come quite a few steps after the primer but are equally important. They will lock in your flawless look, and make sure it doesn’t go anywhere for as long as you need it.

#### Set the right foundation

Now, as mentioned, your foundation has to match your neck and body color. Foundation is also essential because the lights and the webcam can make you look quite pale and washed out. So, while you can go for an “all natural” look, we suggest you apply a lot of foundation. What’s more, it’s always good to use a full-coverage foundation, especially one made to withstand being viewed on an HD television.

Hand in hand with the foundation goes the mighty concealer. You can apply the concealer either before or after your foundation, depending on your make-up routine and preference. A concealer is a great tool, as it allows us to cover up all imperfections and present the best possible look for our viewers.

#### The magic of contouring

Not that long ago, we had to accept and commit to the way our faces look. Well, thanks to Kim Kardashian, among others, we no longer have to. With contouring, you can highlight (or hide) specific parts of our face. Because the camera washes out the skin tone a bit, contouring is also crucial so that your viewers may see your face features. It will give your face dimension and make you look as ethereal as a porcelain doll.

To finish off the contouring, pop some highlight above your cheekbones, on the tip of your nose, and under the brow. The highlight will catch the attention right where you want it.

Of course, don’t forget to apply your blush and add to that ethereal glow you’ve got going on! Applying rosy blush will make your cheeks look flushed as if you are in the throes of passion. That’s precisely what your viewers want to see, as it will boost their fantasy and keep them coming back for more.

### Opulent lashes for that “under the brow” look

To avoid looking washed out, fill in your brows. You can make your eyebrows a bit more angled, for that piercing, “femme fatale” look. Add some long, luscious lashes, and your visitors won’t be able to take their eyes off of you.

### Luscious lips

Of course, no look is complete without lavish, plump lips. You want your lipstick to be pristine and eye-catching. Bold, vibrant lipstick colors are the perfect way to complete the fantasy for your viewers. Give them everything they need, and watch them as they request private chats just so they can keep looking at your fleshy, pouty lips.
