The do’s and don’ts of sexting are there for a few reasons. You need to do some things to make sure you are safe when sexting. You also need to do some things to get the most enjoyment you can out of sexting. The don’ts are things that could get you into trouble, that could cause you to have a bad experience or that could hurt someone else. They are more a guideline than strict rules of sexting.

Sexting is not very different than the physical act of sex. The first time you do it is a learning experiment. The first time you sext you may not know what things to say during sexting. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes and the more enjoyment you can get out of it.

### **Possible Consequences of Sexting**

Sex is something that can impact a person both emotionally and physically. While you may avoid the dangers of getting pregnant or getting an STD through sexting, that does not mean there are not possible consequences when you make mistakes sexting.

Sexting creates a record. Many people have lost jobs, been called out publicly and ruined relationships by engaging in sexting. The things that spread over the internet and on the [free online chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/ "iSexyChat - Chatrooms"), never go away and can come back to haunt you.

When you do [turn to strangers to sext](5-amazing-steps-for-sex-chat-success/ "5 Amazing Steps For Sex Chat Success"), you don’t know if they are telling the truth to you or if they are looking to take advantage of you. Sexting a stranger could mean sexting with a person in prison or with a law enforcement official acting as an underage person. You may think you can talk to girls for free online, but you often get what you pay for.

Even if you sext with someone you have a relationship with, it can come back to haunt you. Sexting photos of yourself to your boyfriend gives them something to brag about or hurt you with if you break up. Take the time to consider all this as you send out the messages and pictures.

## **The Do’s of Sexting:**

### **Get Yourself Ready**

Some people may think that they can look any way they want to when they sext. If there are no live pictures involved, they may think that their appearance does not matter. People that do not take time to get comfortable and sexy do not fully understand the process and often ask what does sext mean?

Sexting is about finding ways to pleasure your body. It is about creating an emotional connection with someone that also involves physical pleasure. If you are going out on a date with a guy, you take the time to make sure you look good and are ready for what may happen later. Do the same with sexting to get the most out of the experience.

### **Watch Your Spell Check**

Accuracy in spelling is important when sexting. Misspelled words or words that autocorrect changes can create uncomfortable situations. They can cause confusion and could lead to resentment from the person receiving these messed up messages. One of the elementary [sexting tips for beginners](/sexting-tips-for-beginners/ "Sexting Tips For Beginners") is to proofread the sext before hitting the send button.

### **Respond in a Timely Manner**

You do need to take the time to make sure you sext the right person and that you don’t have spelling mistakes, but that does not mean you should not respond promptly to your partner’s messages. Doing this can keep the energy of the sexting messages flowing and can keep the action much hotter.

### **Sext the Person You Mean To**

Everyone has made a mistake and sent a text to the wrong person. They may have hit the wrong person on their contact list, or they may not realize that their phone gives them the wrong person via auto-select. There is nothing more embarrassing than sending free adult pics meant for your boyfriend ending up on your mother’s phone. That will take more explaining than anyone wants to do. If you have sexting messages to send to your boyfriend, take the time to doublecheck to make sure he is the one that will get them.

### **Use Slang and Other Shortcuts**

When you sext, you should text the way you talk. For many that include the use of slang terms. Slang can make the sexting more interesting for everyone involved. If you are looking for sexting text for him that will turn him on. The right words can enhance the heat of the moment and are something to embrace rather than ignore.

### **Sext with the People You Trust**

![](/images/Girl-Sexting-on-Phone-e1556879869673.jpg)

One of the do’s of sexting is thinking about the consequences. That means you should only sext with people who you trust. You need to know that they will follow the same list of dos’ and don’t that you do. You should never have to wonder if a person will spread rumors or information about you that you want to keep private. This is true whether you are trying to find girls to sext, guys to sext or something else. If you do choose to turn to an [online sex chat site](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/ "Chatrooms - Sex Chat"), avoid giving out any private or personal information.

### **Keep it Short and To the Point**

Sexting is not a long romance novel. It is a conversation between two people designed to turn each other on. The best way to do this is to avoid texts that are long. There are a few reasons for this. Long texts take time to create. Finding the right words and making sure that everything is spelled correctly requires time and effort. That time can ruin the feeling of intimacy you are trying to create. Long texts are also harder to read and can become confusing. They often defeat the purpose of sexting.

### **Sext before having Sex**

There are some couples who engage in sexting before finally having sex. By doing this, the couple actually might know better about each other, thus creating a virtual picture of what the other person likes in bed. You may figure out some interesting things about your partner during the sexting.

There are other ways to talk to girls to get that desired confidence before having actual sex with someone. A [free online chatting site](https://isexychat.com/ "iSexyChat") is a great place to practice and to learn some things to say when you sext, but keep in mind that they are not the place to engage in full-blown sexting relationships.

## **The Don’ts of Sexting:**

### **Don’t Save Sexting Messages**

Computers and phones have great memories. Other people can also access the history that the phone saves if given the chance. You do not want people other than your boyfriend to see the exchange of dirty sex messages meant for him because you left your phone unlocked and sitting on the coffee table. The best way to prevent this from happening is to delete the messages after you are done sexting. Do not just hit the delete key. Clear the cache and the history to make sure that the things you said sexting to a guy remain only in his mind.

### **Don’t Mix Sexting with Drinking**

Sex when drinking is never as fun as you remember. Sexting while drinking is worse. The chance of making a mistake that can cause problems grows the more you drink. There are many ways that you can get in trouble because you are not paying enough attention as you sext. Imagine trying to figure out [how to talk dirty to a woman over text](/how-to-get-a-girl-wet-with-sexting/ "How To Get A Girl Wet With Sexting") only to find out the next day that you were actually texting with a guy. If that is not something you are in to, you may have to figure a way out.

The alcohol also has a physical effect on the body. You cannot get the pleasure you want or deserve out of the sexting because your mind does think clearly, and your body does not function properly with the alcohol. Leave the sexting to the times when you don’t drink.

### **Acronyms and Emojis are a Problem**

One way to keep messages shorter and to the point is to turn to acronyms and emojis. The problem is that the person you are sexting with is not always familiar with what the acronyms mean and what the sexting emojis mean. Until you are sure that the person receiving the sext understand the acronyms and sexting emojis, stay away from them.

### **Don’t Sext a Picture that Includes Your Face**

![](/images/Dont-Sext-a-Nude-Picture-that-Includes-Your-Face-e1556880005448-1024x639.jpg)

This is something that many people don’t think about. It is easier to identify the person in a picture if you include a shot of their face. These pictures always seem to turn up when you least expect it and never seem to help the person in the picture. If you have to send a picture, consider turning to free adult pics that are available online. It can save you some embarrassment in the future.

#### **To sum it up**

Always remember that sexting is for fun and enjoyment purposes. The same is said of real sex. Most people know that there are things they should do and should not do when it comes to real sex. They need to carry those same thoughts over to sexting. It is the best way to get everything you deserve out of the experience.
