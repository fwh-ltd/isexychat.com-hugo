Anyone who’s ever [joined a sexting chat room](https://isexychat.com/) hoping to meet hot girls will tell you that it’s easier said than done. The odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you: on average, women account for only up to 20% of all sex chat room users. The competition is fierce, so unless you’re into guys as well, you better roll up your sleeves and get to work if you want to score some!

To help you spice your game up, here are six tried-and-tested tips on how to charm and win over those sexy ladies in the girls’ chat room.

## 1. Be Nice

When you chat with real girls rather than paid webcam models, you have to remember that they are out there looking for fun and pleasure — same as you. You are not their client, and they do not have to pay any attention to you unless they feel like it. So don’t even think about playing the bad guy. Rude, disrespectful, or demanding behavior will only get you ignored at best and blocked at worst.

Instead, play nice. Remember to remain courteous, easy-going, and open-minded at all times. Try to approach each new chat partner from a place of positivity and curiosity, and see where the flow of the conversation takes you. Last but not least, don’t forget to always ask for consent when seeking to try out something new.

## 2. Stand Out from the Crowd

Boredom is the number one enemy of good sex. Nothing makes one’s ovaries shrink more than dull small talk with perfect strangers. So, if you want your [sex chat with women to end with cybersex](https://isexychat.com/blog/key-tips-for-having-cybersex-with-strangers/) rather than with them eye-rolling off-screen, you better sharpen up your banter skills.

Make sure not to use the same recycled pick-up lines over and over again. [Tap into your creativity and do your best](https://isexychat.com/blog/dirty-questions-to-ask-hot-girls-in-sex-chat-room/) to come up with original questions and answers. Don’t worry, that’s not nearly as difficult as it seems. No one expects you to reach Shakespearean levels of eloquence, but a few great jokes and some creative compliments here and there can truly do wonders.

## 3. Don’t Give Up

No matter what anyone tells you, success with women is a numbers game. What’s more, that’s just as true in [sex chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/) as it is in real life. Too many guys give up way too soon and miss out on all the fun they could have had if they’d only been a little more patient.

If things don’t seem to be working out for you just yet, hang on in there. Move on to the next girl, put in a good effort, and see what happens then. If she’s into you, that’s awesome! But if you two don’t have much chemistry going on, simply take your leave (politely!) and chat up the next girl. Rinse and repeat until you find your perfect online match.

## 4. Get to Know Her

You may not be able to touch and even see or hear the girl you are chatting with, but she is still a real human being. She has emotions, interests, and hobbies. She has a rich past and a complex inner life. And guess what? Getting to know her better as a person could help you win her over. And if it doesn’t, you could still make great friends.

Don’t shy away from asking her questions that are not explicitly sexual. While you don’t want to get too personal (remember, most people value the [anonymity of a free online sex chat](https://isexychat.com/blog/play-well-in-adult-sexting-chat-room/)), there are plenty of safe topics to talk about. Some great examples include music, movies, gaming, or anything else that she might be into. That could help her relax, open up to you, and… change the subject to something much kinkier.

## 5. Get on the Right Chat Room

In this day and age, there are plenty of online service providers that offer adult chat with women. However, not all sex chat rooms are created equal, and which one you choose can make a big difference. Choose wisely, and you will set yourself up for success later.

Ideally, you want to [find a chat room](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/) that has a good reputation and caters to women. You also want to make sure that your sex room has a high number of visitors — the more, the merrier! We did say it was a numbers’ game, didn’t we?

## 6. Have Fun

Humor and good spirits are highly contagious — and sexy. So take it easy, enjoy yourself, and go with the flow, and you are sure to end up someplace nice!
