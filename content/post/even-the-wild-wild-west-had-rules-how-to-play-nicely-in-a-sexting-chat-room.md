Chat rooms have a particular naughty reputation, although not all of them are used for dirty, middle-of-the-night types of conversations. When people say “chat room,” their minds immediately jump to sexting. Whatever we use them for, there’s just something inherently sexy and alluring about chat rooms.

## **Why visit safe chat rooms for adults**

Thanks to the ever-expanding modern miracle of the internet, chat rooms are no longer frowned upon, and we can all take a breather at the end of the day (or during the day, whatever floats your boat) and chat with some strangers. It’s easy, it can get your mind off of everyday things, and it can get you off. So why not visit safe chat rooms for adults?

Well, many are still afraid of venturing into the lands of free [online sexting chat rooms](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/sex-chat/ "Chatrooms - Sex Chat") because they are unsure of the proper etiquette.

## **The best adult chat rooms have rules — why?**

Humans are used to rules. Although the thought of going wild and abandoning any decorum seems alluring, it’s actually no one’s desire to be a part of pure pandemonium. Hence — rules. Some are common sense and can be applied to all types of chat rooms, and others are pretty sex chat-specific.

## **How to behave in a random sex chat room**

If you have one, steady chat partner, that’s similar to being in a relationship — you and your partner set up the guidelines, and agree on all and any rules. However, when you’re using an open sex chat like the [iSexy Chatroom](https://isexychat.com/ "iSexyChat"), for example, there are some standard rules you should follow.

### **Don’t be ignorant**

Whenever you [join a chat room](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/ "iSexyChat - Chatrooms"), find out what the [general rules are](https://isexychat.com/rules/ "iSexyChat - Rules"). Maybe the chat room has a roleplay going on, that all participants need to stick to, or it’s theme-specific. Either way, read the rules and regulations before you dive in.

### **Don’t lie**

We’re not talking “oh, I have a ten-inch monster in my pants” type of a lie. No. We’re talking “I’m over 18” when in reality you really aren’t. Some lies are perfectly fine because they play up the fantasy. Others, however, can be very damaging. If you’re under 18 years of age, there’s no room for you in any adult sex chat room.

### **Don’t out people (or yourself)**

Half of the charm that adult chat rooms have is anonymity. Do not endanger that unless all parties are in agreement. That goes both ways — don’t out other people (dox them) if you figure out their real-life identity. They aren’t there to be the Regular Joe from down the street. Leave them be and keep pretending they are in fact, the sexy, mysterious people they want to be. Furthermore, if other chat participants don’t want to know your real-life identity, don’t throw it in their faces. Keep the mystery alive.

### **Use common sense**

A lot of sex chat decorum revolves around common sense. Some people call this the “bar rule” — if you wouldn’t do it in a bar, don’t do it in a sex chat. Don’t jump into established conversations to try to steer them forcefully in another direction. You wouldn’t approach a group of people in a bar and interrupt their chat about cars to talk about cats, would you? So, stick to the theme and don’t interrupt.

### **Only sexy talk allowed**

If you’ve chosen to enter an [adult chat room](https://isexychat.com/chatrooms/general-chat/ "Chatrooms - General Chat"), and the conversation that’s going on is purely sexual in nature, don’t try to jump to other topics. No one wants to talk about Trump, the gas prices, or the weather while trying to get their freak on. In fact, it would be a smart idea to stay away from politics altogether. That’s a risky subject even in real-life, and it’s definitely not sexy. The exceptions are, of course, politically-themed sex chat rooms. However, even in those, you have to follow the [guidelines](https://isexychat.com/terms/ "iSexyChat - Terms"). You can’t just bash or roleplay as any political figure.

### **Respect other people’s wishes**

If your chat room partners aren’t interested in something you’d like to talk about — respect their wishes. A good rule of thumb is to avoid doing anything that you’d mind being done to you.

Furthermore, if you’re diving into a somewhat risky chat, make sure to use trigger warnings. Of course, you don’t need them for everything, but, let’s be real — you’re probably well aware of which topics might need a trigger warning. If you’re chatting about regular, vanilla sex, there’s no need for warnings of any kind. But if you want to bring up bondage and humiliation, you can’t do it without a fair heads-up to other chat room participants.

### **Chat rooms are for chatting**

Sometimes people think that they can take advantage of having access to so many people at the same time. Chat rooms might seem like an excellent promo opportunity, but promoting or trying to sell something in an adult sex chat room will quickly get you banned.

### **Don’t troll**

Don’t be a troll. Don’t be a troll. Don’t be a… see how annoying that is? Don’t flood the chat with messages if you see that no one is responding. That’s a jerk move. Furthermore, don’t send provocative (and by provocative, we don’t mean sexy, but rather jerk-like) messages just to get a rise out of somebody or annoy them. Sex chats are intended to be fun, don’t ruin it for everybody.

## **The language of adult chat rooms**

Free online sex chat rooms aren’t an opportunity to get everything off your chest and say stuff you wouldn’t usually say in person. Well, they are — but only to an extent. You still have to be mindful of what you say and how you say it.

### **Try to be politically correct**

Racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and homophobic messages are a big no-no in most chat rooms. Of course, most chats will have quite a bit of crude language in them. However, there’s a massive difference between swearing and using racial or any other types of slurs.

### **Don’t shout**

Using caps lock will make most people uncomfortable. You can use it, of course, but make sure to practice moderation. Otherwise, people will think you’re yelling at them.

### **Don’t go overboard with acronyms and abbreviations**

Most chat room visitors use standard abbreviations and acronyms — brb, ttyl, wyd, etc. It’s an easy way to communicate with someone quickly. However, make sure you don’t go overboard with them, as not everyone has the in-depth knowledge that you might do.
